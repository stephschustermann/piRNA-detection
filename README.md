# piRNA-detection

piRNA detection via multidimensional small RNA clustering
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA) are a novel class of small RNA molecules thought to mediate retrotransposon silecing. Since transposable elements (TEs) can serve as mutagenic factors that contribute to genomic instability, piRNA function is extremely important for genome defense.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the program

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Files

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
